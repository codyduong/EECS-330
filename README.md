# EECS 330 - Data Structures

Taken with [Dr. Zijun Yao](https://sites.google.com/view/zijunyao/) in Fall 2023.

All lab info/instructions are available at the ~~[KU-EECS330 Fall23/lab-schedule](https://github.com/ku-eecs330/lab-schedule)~~ public repository

> [!WARNING]
> It looks like the original `lab-schedule` repository was overwritten with Fall 2024. As such the original lab instructions have been lost. 
> As long as labs remain mostly similiar, you may be able to extrapolate some usage from this repository.

## Grades

> [!NOTE]
> Lab 1 was optional and non-graded
>
> Lab 3 had extra credit
>
> Lab 4 had two major parts (hence out of 200 instead of 100)
>
> Lab 10 received 10 points deduced (unknown reason)
